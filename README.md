These codes are for review purposes only.

First, download "00miceSVM.R" on your computer. This is the file that the author created as multiple imputation based on the support vector machine using multivariate imputation by chained equations (mice). After downloding this file, you can use miceSVM in conjunction with R package mice.

Second, download the files (01Tbale1, 02Table1). These files allow you to replicate the results reported in Table 1. Set the directory where you saved 00miceSVM.R. For example, source("C://Users//...//00miceSVM.R"). Copy and paste the entire code into R.

Third, download the files (03Tbale2, 04Table2, 05Table2). These files allow you to replicate the results reported in Table 2. Set the directory where you saved 00miceSVM.R. For example, source("C://Users//...//00miceSVM.R"). Copy and paste the entire code into R.

Fourth, download the files (06Tbale3, 07Table3). Also, download the files (EVS1, EVS2). These files allow you to replicate the results reported in Table 3. Set the directory where you saved 00miceSVM.R. For example, source("C://Users//...//00miceSVM.R"). Copy and paste the entire code into R. The window pops up, so choose EVS1.csv for 06Table3, or EVS2.csv for 07Table3.
